### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: code is underdeveloped help improve it
- **qa-needed**: answer questions for others
- **documentation-needed**: document some code that was left undocumented
- **bug-high-priority**: Bugs that need to be fixed before the project can continue
- **bug-low-priority**: minor issues were found that need fixes
- **help-wanted**: help the main part of the project

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
